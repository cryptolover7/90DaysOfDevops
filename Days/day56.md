## The Big Picture: IaC

Humans make mistake! Automation is the way to go! 

How do you build your systems today? 

What would be your plan if you were to lose everything today, Physical machines, Virtual Machines, Cloud VMs, Cloud PaaS etc etc.? 

How long would it take you to replace everything? 

Infrastructure as code provides a solution to be able to do this whilst also being able to test this, we should not confuse this with backup and recovery but in terms of your infrastructure and environments, your platforms we should be able to spin them up and treat them as cattle vs pets. 

The TLDR; is that we can use code to rebuild our whole entire environment. 

If we also remember from the start we said about DevOps in general is a way in which to break down barriers to deliver systems into production safely and rapidly. 

Infrastructure as code helps us deliver the systems, we have spoken a lot of processes and tools. IaC brings us more tools to be familiar with to enable this part of the process. 

We are going to concentrate on Infrastructure as code in this section. You might also hear this mentioned as Infrastructure from code or configuration as code. I think the most well known term is likely Infrastructure as code.
