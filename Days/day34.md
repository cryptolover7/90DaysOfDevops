## Microsoft Azure Hands-On Scenarios

The last 6 days have been focused on Microsoft Azure and the public cloud in general, a lot of this foundation had to contain a lot of theory to understand the building blocks of Azure but also this will nicely translate to the other major cloud providers as well. 

I mentioned at the very beginning about getting a foundational knowledge of the public cloud and choosing one provider to at least begin with, if you are dancing between different clouds then I believe you can get lost quite easily whereas choosing one you get to understand the fundamentals and when you have those it is quite easy to jump into the other clouds and accelerate your learning. 

In this final session, I am going to be picking and choosing my hands-on scenarios from this page here which is a reference created by Microsoft and is used for preparations for the [AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/) There are some here such as Containers and Kubernetes that we have not covered in any detail as of yet so I don't want to jump in there just yet. 

In previous posts, we have created most of Modules 1,2 and 3. 

### Virtual Networking 

### Network Traffic Management 

### Azure Storage 

### Virtual Machines 

### Serverless (Implement Web Apps)
