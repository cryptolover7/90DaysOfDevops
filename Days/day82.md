### EFK Stack 

In the previous section, we spoke about ELK Stack, which uses Logstash as the log collector in the stack, in the EFK Stack we are swapping that out for FluentD. 




If EFK stack is not enough we could take a look at APM (Application Performance Monitoring), SigNoz, which uses OpenTelemetry - a vendor-agnostic instrumentation library for generating telemetry data. OpenTelemetry is a project under Cloud Native Computing Foundation and is becoming the industry standard for creating portable telemetry data.
