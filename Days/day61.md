### Multiple Environments 

If we wanted to take any of the demos we have ran through but wanted to now have specific production, staging and development environments looking exactly the same and leveraging this code there are two approaches to achieve this with Terraform 

- `terraform workspaces` - multiple named sections within a single backend 

- file structure - Directory layout provides separation, modules provide reuse. 

Each of the above do have their pros and cons though.
