## The Big Picture: Kubernetes

In the last section we covered Containers, Containers full short when it comes to scale and orchestration alone. The best we can do is use docker-compose to bring up multiple containers together. When it comes to Kubernetes which is a Container Orchestrator. 

### What is Container Orchestration?

I have mentioned Kubernetes and I have mentioned Container Orchestration, Kubernetes is the technology where as the container orchestration is the concept or the process behind the technology. What I mean is that Kubernetes is not the only Container Orchestration platform we also have Docker Swarm, HashiCorp Nomad and others. But Kubernetes is going from strength to strength so I want to cover Kubernetes but wanted to say that it is not the only one out there. 

### What is Kubernetes 


### Main Kubernetes Components 

Kubernetes Architecture 

Kubectl Commands 
Kubernetes YAML 

Kubernetes Ingress 
Kubernetes Services

Helm Package Manager 

Persistant Storage

Demo Overview - Should be demos throughout of building a simple pod deployment but then we want to build additional pods and storage with ingress and services included.
