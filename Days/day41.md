## The Open Source Workflow 
    Fork a Project 
    Clones to local machine 
    Contributes and commits changes to local fork 
    We dont have the ability to push our changes to the master project 
    Submit the changes to original project 
    Push to dev repo 
    Sending a Pull Request
    maintainer checks and discusses maybe even automated tests. 
    maintainer can pull changes from fork
