## Dev workstation setup - All the pretty things

Not to be confused with us setting Linux servers up this way but I wanted to also show off the choice and flexibility that we have within the Linux desktop. 

I have been using a Linux Desktop for almost a year now and I have it configured just the way I want from a look and feel perspective. 

A lot of this comes down to dotfiles something we will cover in this final Linux session of the series. 

### dotfiles 


### ZSH 


### OhMyZSH
