## The Big Picture - Containers 

We are now starting the next section and this section is going to be focused on containers and in particular we are likely going to be looking into Docker and get into some of the key areas to understand more about Containers. 

I will also be trying to get some hands on here to create our own container that we can use later on during this section but also future sections later on in the challenge. 

As always this first post is going to be focused on the big picture of how we got here and what it all means.
