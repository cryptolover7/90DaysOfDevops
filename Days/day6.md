### Recap of our first few days looking at DevOps

- DevOps is a combo of Development and Operations that allows a single team to manage the whole application development lifecycle that consists of **Development**, **Testing**, **Deployment**, **Operations**. 

- The main focus and aim of DevOps is to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes and functionality frequently in close alignment with business objectives. 

- DevOps is a software development approach through which software can be delivered and developed reliably and quickly. You may also see this referenced as **Continuous Development, Testing, Deployment, Monitoring**
